# Report

## Part 1

**1. Give a short explanation about the data and the models we created. Include brief statements about the data and the differences between the two datasets. (1 pt)**
_Your answer should only be a few sentences long, and be sure to use quantitative information! You do not need to reproduce the model, but at least specify model parameters (physical meaning), observation types, redundancy, etc. You can use bullet lists to summarize and state interesting information._



## Part 2

**2. Assess the precision (include values!) and significance of the estimated parameters. (2 pt)**
_To include in your answer: What information is contained in the covariance matrix? How to interpret the values (given the physical meaning of the parameters)?_ 



## Part 3

**3. Based on an analysis of the fitted model and residuals and their confidence intervals: do you think the fitted model is correct? (4 pt)**
*To include in your report and answer:*

- *One figure with observations, fitted model and confidence intervals of fitted model ($\hat{y}$)*
- *One figure to support your answer to the next question about distribution of residuals*
- *Is the distribution of the residuals as expected? Why or why not?*
- *What information do the confidence intervals give you?*
- *Why are so many observations outside the confidence interval of the fitted model ($\hat{y}$)?*




## Part 4

**4. Compare the results you found for the InSAR observations and the GNSS observations. Discuss/explain the differences, taking into account the different properties of the datasets. Be quantitative. (1 pt)**



## Part 5

**5. What would you advise the authorities in terms of long-term monitoring strategy: use GNSS, InSAR, or both? Justify your choice based on the results previous questions. (1 pt)** *To include: how would you change your processing strategy when using both GNSS and InSAR data? (you need to answer this question, even if you recommend to use only of the two)*
